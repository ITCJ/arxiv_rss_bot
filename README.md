Yet, the exchange of model updates between the participants and the aggregator can still leak sensitive information. In this work, we present a new gradien...

#### Abstract
Deep neural networks are widely deployed with quantization techniques to reduce memory and computational costs by lowering the numerical precision of their parameters. While quantization alters model parameters and their outputs, existing privacy analyses primarily focus on full-precision models, le...

**Score**: 1.0  
**Type**: new  
**ArXiv ID**: 2512.15493v1  

#### Abstract
Equivariance is a powerful prior for learning physical dynamics, yet exact group equivariance can degrade performance if the symmetries are broken. We propose object-centric world models built with geometric algebra neural networks, providing a soft geometric inductive bias. Our models are evaluated...

**Type**: new  
**ArXiv ID**: 2512.15600v1  

#### Abstract
Going from pure Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to a learnable graph message-passing mechanism at each layer has been foundational to state-of-the-art results, despite the computational trade-off (e.g. GATs or Transformers). To go a step further, in this work, we introduce N-simplicial attention, going ...

#### Abstract
Semantic communication aims to transmit information most relevant to a task rather than raw data, offering significant gains in communication efficiency for applications such as telepresence, augmented reality, and remote sensing. Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to ...

### 47. [Learning Model Parameter Dynamics in a Combination Therapy for Bladder Cancer from Sparse Biological Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15706)

**Authors**: Kayode Olumoyin, Lamees El Naqa, Katarzyna Rejniak  
**Category**: cs.LG  
**Published**: 2025-12-18  
**Score**: 1.0  
**Type**: new  
**ArXiv ID**: 2512.15706v1  

#### Abstract
In a mathematical model of interacting biological organisms, where external interventions may alter behavior over time, traditional models that assume fixed parameters usually do not capture the evolving dynamics. In oncology, this is further exacerbated by the fact that experimental data are often ...

#### Abstract
The quadratic computational complexity of MultiHead SelfAttention (MHSA) remains a fundamental bottleneck in scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) for longcontext tasks. While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global depen...

The concept of inflection classes is an abstraction used by linguists, and provides a means to describe patterns in languages that give an analogical base for deducing previously unencountered forms. This ability is an important part of morphological acquisition and processing. We study the learnabi...
